                      <hr>
                      <p class="text-muted ml-5 mr-5">Over the last fifteen years I have developed skills in
                        pastry and
                        confections
                        production, as well as the extreme attention to detail required. At a young age, I developed a
                        deep culinary
                        interest, and pursued a culinary career
                        through high school, where I completed the highest-level culinary classes offered. I then
                        attended Central
                        Piedmont
                        Community College, where I earned both the Culinary Arts and Baking and Pastry Arts degrees.
                        During my
                        studies,
                        I honed
                        my skills as a line and prep cook at several restaurants. After graduation, I worked at two
                        country clubs as
                        the pastry
                        chef, I ran a chocoloate shop and also have worked at a boutique hotel. At all of those venues,
                        not only did I
                        plan, delegate, prepare and
                        execute desserts, but also assisted in various stages of savory
                        food preparation for high-volume banquets.
                      </p>

                      <p class="text-muted ml-5 mr-5">
                        I have an easy-going personality, and the ability to focus under extreme stress to complete
                        projects at the
                        highest
                        standards. I also have experience in menu planning for small to large-scale banquets of up to
                        600 people. In
                        the past,
                        I have been commended by colleagues and chef instructors on my clear and concise verbal
                        communication
                        abilities,
                        attention to detail, and ability to delegate based on skill levels
                      </p>

                      <p class="text-muted ml-5 mr-5">
                        Many skills in pastry have developed naturally for me and I have continued to
                        seek out and experiment with new techniques. Of course, this all came with moments of
                        frustration trying to
                        perfect
                        my pastry skills. I recognize that coding may or may not come naturally, but regardless,
                        I must continue to use what I have learned in my past career in regards to planning and breaking
                        projects into
                        smaller
                        tasks in order to reach the desired end goal, and also recognize there will also be moments of
                        frustration,
                        and
                        continue seeking the latest techniques.
